## 🚀 About Me

Hi! I'm Toni Gbolahan, a Data Science undergraduate at the University of Texas at Dallas with a focus on **Cybersecurity**. I have experience in customer-facing roles and team leadership, which has strengthened my communication and time management skills.

I’m passionate about building functional, user-friendly software and have hands-on experience in **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **web development**. My projects range from text-based games to console banking systems, where I apply object-oriented programming, data validation, and user interaction design.
